- Combining and displaying output

For detailed explanation please read [Notebook](https://github.com/Tanay-27/HandWritten_OCR/blob/main/BankFormTask/Internship_Task.ipynb)

In this task 2 models have been used, they can be found at [MNIST](https://github.com/Tanay-27/ML_Hackathons-Projects/blob/master/Digit_Prediction/mnist.ipynb) and [HTR](https://www.kaggle.com/tanay27/handwritten-digit-classifier)

This shows the items that were checked in sample form

This shows the dates appended

Pl note, due to scanning issues I have had to take image from phone and use. This induced a lot of noise which has proved difficult to remove. Scanned pages work with pretty good accuracy on the OCR
