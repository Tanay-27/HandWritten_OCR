The dataset for this has been taken and preprocessed for utility purposes by manually naming each folder and preprocessing images to a standard size of 28x28 pixels as well as storing them in the form of csv files for direct implementation to CNNs.
The dataset contains 62 files - 26 each of upper and lower characters and 10 digits.
Before combining one will have to add collumn names to the dataframe for concatenation.
